# System Design Basics

## Vertical Scaling vs Horizontal Scaling

* Vertical scaling means adding more power to the CPU by increasing its resources such as RAM. This is done
by upgrading the current specs of system or adding more featuers to our current system.
* Horizontal scaling means adding more resources to our existing pool of resources. We can achieve this by adding more machines to our current setup.
