### Reservoir sampling

```sh
Reservoir sampling is a family of randomized algorithms for choosing a simple random sample, without replacement,
of k items from a population of unknown size n in a single pass over the items. 

The size of the population is not known to the algorithm and it is typically too large to be stored in main memory.
