### Monotonic Stack

```
A monotonic stack has all the functionalities of the normal stack, the only difference is that all the elements in the monotonic stack are either increasing or decreasing.

If a problem is suitable to use monotonic stack, it has atleast 3 charaters :
• It is a "range query in a array" problem.
• The minima/maxima element or the monotonic order of elements in a range is useful to get answer of every range query.
• When a element is popped out of monotonic stack it will never be used again.
