### Minimum distance between two node in a N-ary tree.

(Note : This is not a leetcode question, its just there for practice)

```
Given a N ary Tree consisting of N nodes, the task is to find the minimum distance from node A to node B of the tree.

Examples:

Input:              
         1          
    /         \

 /  \       /  \   \
4   5    6    7   8
A = 4, B = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: The path 4->2->1->3 gives the minimum distance from A to B.

Input:
         1          
   /         \      
2            3
