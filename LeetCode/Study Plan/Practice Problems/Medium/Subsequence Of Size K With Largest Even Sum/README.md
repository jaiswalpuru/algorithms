### 2098. Subsequence of Size K With the Largest Even Sum

```
You are given an integer array nums and an integer k. Find the largest even sum of any subsequence of nums that has a length of k.

Return this sum, or -1 if such a sum does not exist.

A subsequence is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [4,1,5,3,1], k = 3
Output: 12
Explanation:
The subsequence with the largest possible even sum is [4,5,3]. It has a sum of 4 + 5 + 3 = 12.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,6,2], k = 3
Output: 12
Explanation:
The subsequence with the largest possible even sum is [4,6,2]. It has a sum of 4 + 6 + 2 = 12.

Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,3,5], k = 1
Output: -1
Explanation:
No subsequence of nums with length 1 has an even sum.

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
0 <= nums[i] <= 10^5
1 <= k <= nums.length
