### ALgorithms

I created this repo to learn and understand algorithms.
Algorithms became more interesting to me after taking Algorithms class under 
[Prof Benjamin Raichel](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~bar150630/) and distributed algorithms 
under [Prof Neeraj Mittal](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~neerajm/).

During my undergrad also I had interest but didn't do much.
I was planning to pursue PHD but I am not sure, so this will not happen.

```Note: The defintions you see here will containx mix of Jeff Erickson and CLRS algorithms book.```
