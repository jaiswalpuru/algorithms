### ALgorithms

I created this repo to learn and understand algorithms.
I started loving algorithms, when I took my graduate course under 
[Prof Benjamin Raichel](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~bar150630/) and in my last semester 
I took distributed algorithms under [Prof Neeraj Mittal](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~neerajm/).

During my undergrad also I had interest but didn't do much.
I was planning to pursue PHD but I am not sure, so this will not happen.
